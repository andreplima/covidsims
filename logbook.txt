# Where are you going?
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	What is the problem being approached by the group?
	 To develop an epidemiological model to inform the selection of interventions to contain COVID-19 spread in the Brazilian territory. In other words, to develop a model to assign a measure of comparative efficiency to available interventions.

	Why are we spending our precious time approaching this problem?
		To contribute to ongoing efforts to ameliorate socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19.

	Materials: health surveillance data obtained from an online platform [1].

	Method: the group will adopt a number of methods to tackle the problem:

		{STATE; this is where I believe we are headed now}
		(1) A data-driven method to fit a SIRD model to surveillance data, aiming to forecast the evolution of new infections, recoveries, and deaths in the short-term. This fitting will be done by exploring machine learning strategies.
		It must be noticed though that this model seeks to forecast the disease short-term dynamics under the assumption that no intervention will be made by health authorities. {CONTROVERSE} This premise severely circumscribes the use of the model to indicate that some intervention ought to be made to reduce some relevant risk, such as excess demand for bed-days or ICU-days. The model would be more useful if it could be used to support the selection (and calibration) of available interventions to contain the spread of the disease (as in [10]).

# SIR-like epidemiological models
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Typical variables of SIR-like models:

		[população, N]: The number of individuals in a territorry
		[Suscetible, S(t)]: The number of susceptible individuals (a counting variable)
		[Infectious, I(t)]: The number of infectious individuals (a counting variable); also infected; infective
		[Recovered, R(t)]: The number of recovered (and immune) individuals (a counting variable)
		[Deceased, D(t)]: The number of deceased individuals (a counting variable)
		[$\beta$]: transmission rate [1], contact rate [3]
		[$\gamma$]: recovery rate in SIR model [1]
		[$\gamma_r$]: recovery rate in SIRD model [1]
		[$\gamma_d$]: death rate in SIRD model [1], infection fatality ratio?
		[$R_0$]: Basic case reproduction number, $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$

		[attack rate]: [10]

	Making explicit the assumptions of the SIR model:
		(1) {TO DO} see [4,5]

	A couple of distinctions that are relevant to clarify some typical sources of modelling errors in epidemiology:

		(1) epidemic vs endemic models [4]: "Epidemic models are used to describe rapid outbreaks that occur in less than one year, while endemic models are used for studying diseases over longer periods, during which there is a renewal of susceptibles by births or recovery from temporary immunity."

		(2) macro vs micro models: macro models seek to represent the disease dynamics at the population level (e.g., SIR-like models), whereas micro models seek to simulate the disease dynamics at lower levels (e.g. individual-based models).

			(2.1) Ferguson's research group at the Imperial College has being using the latter: "We parameterize an individual-based simulation model of pandemic influenza transmission for GB and the US using high-resolution population density data and data on travel patterns. We extend the model by incorporating realistic seeding of infection (via international travel) in the modelled countries, and by explicitly modelling air travel within the US (air travel being relatively insignificant in GB due to its much smaller size). The model represents transmission in households, schools and workplaces, and the wider community." [10]

			{TO DO} Ask IBGE/CS if 2022 NAtional Census will collect data to create a simulation model similar to [10].

			(2.2) What do you mean by "level"? See [12].

# Questions and attempted answers
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are SIR-like models still being applied in modern literature on epidemiology?
	Yes, it seems:
	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00748-2
	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435621000871
	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80007-8

Are SIR-like models been taught to students in health-related tracks?
	Well, I could not find any reference to SIR-like models in Gordis (new version) [13] and Stefens [14], which are textbooks used in courses on epidemiology in our university [15]. I wonder why is that so.

An important assumption of the SIR model is that recovered individuals are permanently immune to the disease. How confident are we rationally warranted to believe that this is the case with COVID-19? After all, there is evidence suggesting that recurrence and reinfection may occur:

Tarefa que eu peguei:
1-) estamos sem os dados dos recovered. Seria interessante olharmos a referência dos dados do Infotracker para o cálculo dos recovered, baseada na metodologia da Universidade de Melbourne ( http://covid19forecast.science.unimelb.edu.au/ ); resumindo, precisamos estimar o parâmetro Rdata;

	Conforme nota publicada em https://www.viser.com.br/covid-19/sp-covid-info-tracker, "para aferir A(t) e Rec(t) tal como apresentada na plataforma on-line, foi considerada a Metodologia 2"

	Não sei como os dados foram coletados pela Diany e Matheus
		resuminho rápido do que temos em dados: infectados até determinado dia, infectados exatamente naquele dia, óbitos acumulados, óbitos em determinado dia; os dados são todos diários, e temos dados desde fevereiro de 2020 até ontem. os dados limpos são do estado de São Paulo, mas tenho para o Brasil todo também
